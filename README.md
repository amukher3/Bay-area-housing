Web_scrapping Craigslist for doing EDA etc. 

This is an effort to analyse and explore the ads in craigslist from almost every possible aspect. The data is initially scrapped from Craigslist. After scrapping the data-set I have tried to clean it as much as possible. 
After scrapping and cleaning I tried to extract as many features as possible. Features such as #Bedrooms,#Baths,#Area,#Price,#Patios and types of it,Pet friednliness etc were extracted. I have tried to explore the data-set from features that I could extract.

Various insights about the distributions of the features were calculated and explored. I am assuming the results are self-explanatory but if the reader finds any contradiction I can be reached via email at `abhi0787@gmail.com` or `amukher3@rockets.utoledo.edu`
